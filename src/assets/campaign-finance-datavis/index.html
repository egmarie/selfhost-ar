          <p>The 2020 Democratic primary race is in full swing, and states are casting votes after months of rallies, debates, and social media advertisements. Soon, voters themselves will evaluate candidates and decide who will lead the Democratic party into the general election in November.</p>
          <p>While votes make the final decision, they aren't the only goal: modern political campaigns are fund-raising machines that kick into gear years before the election. To some degree, the candidates' success at the ballot box is determined by how big of a war chest they've built up this past summer and fall.</p>

      <section class="text-section">
        <div class="container">
          <p>That's why candidates flood inboxes with fundraising asks, create elaborate Facebook campaigns, and plug their website on the debate stage. It's also why some have already dropped out before votes were even cast: those who couldn't get enough donors simply didn't have the cash to compete against bigger bank accounts.</p>
          <p>Federal campaign finance rules give us a remarkably clear-eyed view into each candidate's fundraising operation, because the campaigns must file statements about contributions, expenditures, and cash on hand on a quarterly basis. That data can reveal a surprising amount about how each campaign is doing in the race for dollars.</p>

          <p>By looking at a campaign's total fundraising, we can get a measure of how successful they've been over the last year — and maybe predict how they will perform in upcoming primaries.</p>
          <p>It's even more interesting to compare the fundraising amounts against candidates' performance in national polls, to see which candidates are polling well despite an apparent disadvantage in fundraising.</p>

          <p>This primary cycle has been marked by a sharp debate about wealthy donors and their relationship to campaigns.</p>
          <p>Some candidates have decided to aim for small-dollar donations from grassroots supporters online. Others have relied on the traditional high-dollar banquets and wealthy party donors, who often give the maximum $2,800.</p>

          <p>In November, the question was disrupted by a new entrant — former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg — who brought his immense personal fortune to help his campaign. Bloomberg refused to accept donations at all, arguing that his own money would limit the influence of outside donors.</p>
          <p>The businessman has since poured more than $500 million into his election effort, dwarfing the total spending of the other candidates in just a few months.</p>

          <p>All of this is only the beginning of what is already the most expensive campaign cycle in history. In the nine months between now and November, millions, and maybe billions more will be spent by campaigns on both sides of the aisle.</p>
          <p>The whole time, you can expect to hear candidates and citizens alike debate the merits of big money in politics, and the influence those donors might have over policy or governance. That's all the more reason to pay close attention to it, and take advantage of public data that help show how the U.S. political system funds itself.</p>
